# Baby Health Monitoring Database

<b>Background:</b> The MGB group develops biosensors and microfluidic devices that provide real-time chemical information about patient health. <br>
<b>Collaboration:</b> The MGB group collaborates with a consultant neonatologist at Hammersmith Hospital to monitor premature babies’ health. The babies have underdeveloped metabolism; therefore, monitoring changes in their blood glucose and lactate concentration is useful. <br>
<b>Challenge:</b> Develop a data inspection and display app (Android) for the clinicians. This should be able to retrieve current and past data and display it in a clinically meaningful way. <br>

The Baby Health Monitoring Database is designed to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/cpark158/PrematureBabyMonitoringApp">the Premature Baby Monitoring App</a>. The server side program enables the communication between a remote SQL database and an Android client (or any application using JSON format for requests).
